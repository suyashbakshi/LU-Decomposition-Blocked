# LU-Decomposition-Blocked
Implementation of LU decomposition of a matrix.

The code structure of "LU_Decomposition()" is taken from NERSC website example here: https://www.nersc.gov/users/software/programming-models/openmp/openmp-tasking/openmp-tasking-example-lu/

Implementation of row_func(), col_func(), inner_func() and diag_func() was implemented by me (Suyash Bakshi).

Feel free to use/modify/distribute the code.
